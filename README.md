This repo contains relavant files for either pulling the existing docker image (almost 99.99% likely what you need) or building our docker from scratch on jetson-tx2. Note that docker should be used as step toward familiarzing yourself with MAVBench. If you are serious about using MAVBench to do research, please use the stand alone build [MAVBench](https://github.com/MAVBench/tx2) to get access to various utilities such as profiling tools.
